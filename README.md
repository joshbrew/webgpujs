## WebGPUjs

Write full featured WGSL pipelines in plain javascript.

We are using some boilerplate conventions but things like vertex buffer allocation or type inferencing for textures etc and so on could be a lot better. Nothing is documented yet until we're happy with it so just try to play with the examples if you are feeling motivated. 

**Work in Progress**

To run the example: `npm i -g tinybuild` then `npm run example`
